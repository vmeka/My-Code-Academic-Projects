Assign1: Due 11:59PM September 24th

Given some names (like, for example, Adithya, Alex, Alex, Avinash, Benjamin, Brandon, Brian, 
Chuong, Conno, David, Deepa, Duy, Felipe, Gabriel, Haripriya, James, John, Joshua, Joshua, 
Narayana, Naveen, Phanindra, Pradhith, Randal, Sachin, Sampath, Tejas, Tharun, Venkat, 
Viswanathan, Yeshes) write functions to perform the following operations.

1. Using mutability and imperative style, compute the frequency of occurrence of each letter 
in the collection of given names. Consider the letters to be case insensitive, that is
consider 'A' and 'a' to be the same. Don't include any letter that's not in any of the
names.

2. Using mutability and imperative style, create a collection with the number of letters in 
the names as the key and the values being the names with that number of letters. For 
example, 3 -> Duy, 4 -> "Alex", "Alex", "John", ... Don't include any length as key if there 
are no names with that length.

3. Using immutability and functions style, compute the frequency of occurrence of each 
letter in the collection of given names. Consider the letters to be case insensitive, that 
is consider 'A' and 'a' to be the same.

4. Using immutability and functions style, create a collection with the number of letters in 
the names as the key and the values being the names with that number of letters. For 
example, 3 -> Duy, 4 -> "Alex", "Alex", "John", ... Don't include any length as key if there 
are no names with that length.

Keep the printing of the results separate from the code that does the actual work.

The functions should take any collection of names as parameter, not just the above example 
names.

Use two different languages (one for 1 and 2 and another for 3 and 4).
Start small, one problem at a time, and ask for frequent reviews.

Include a run command (.sh file or a .cmd file) that will compile (if necessary) and run the 
code samples. Keep the code in separate files with appropriate language extensions.
