Assignment 3: Due 11:59PM Nov. 8

A publisher is interested in keeping track of the rankings of their books on Amazon.
They've asked us to write a program that will go out to Amazon with ISBN numbers,
fetch the ranking of the books, and report the following details:

Book title  isbn rank
...			...	 ...
...			...	 ...
...			...	 ...
...			...	 ...
...			...	 ...
...			...	 ...
...			...	 ...

The report is printed in the order of the ranks, from the highest rank to the lowest.

First implement the code using sequential solution, where the code goes to Amazon with one ISBN number
at a time. Work with a few ISBN numbers (10 or 20) as an example to try out the program.

Then make the code concurrent, using the traditional threading and synchronization approach.
Use proper locks to avoid race conditions.

In addition to printing the result, print also the time each of the solutions take (in seconds).
